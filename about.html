  Hello! I'm Ashvin and I'm a current PhD student at 
  <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a> 
  on the 
  <a href="https://ai4health.io/">AI for Healthcare CDT</a> and part of the 
  <a href="https://spike.doc.ic.ac.uk/">SPIKE</a> group under Professor Alessandra Russo.
  My research is focused on trying to diagnosis multiple cancers from the EHR data using machine learning
  as well as building a computational model of the NICE guidelines for cancer management. 
</p>

<p>
    The PhD is a great opportunity to learn and grow as a researcher and I've set this blog up to 
    share my thoughts and learnings on the projects I'm working, life as a PhD student
    and lessons from the modules I am assisting with.
